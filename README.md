# Frozen-Lake-Environment-Using-Reinforcement-Learning-
The enviornment I loaded above FrozenLake-v1 is one of the simplest enviornments in Open AI Gym. The goal of the agent is to navigate a frozen lake and find the Goal without falling through the ice (render the enviornment above to see an example).

There are:

16 states (one for each square)
4 possible actions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP)
4 different types of blocks (F: frozen, H: hole, S: start, G: goal)
